## Project Overview

A short description of the task or problem your system solves, including the intended
“customer” or end-user

A summary of the robot’s functionality.

A short video (e.g. 10-30s) of the robot completing one full cycle/operation
demonstrating closed-loop behaviour and visualisation. (This could be embedded or an
external link to a YouTube/OneDrive/Google Drive video.)


## System Architecture
 - A diagram of your ROS2 nodes, topics, services and actions (e.g. from rqt_graph or a
custom schematic).
- A package-level architecture diagram showing node interactions and topics.
- A behaviour-tree or state-machine diagram showing closed-loop system behaviour.
- A brief description of the function of each node.
- Any custom message types or interfaces should be listed and explained.

## Technical Components
- Computer Vision: describe your vision pipeline and how it contributes to the task.
- Custom End-Effector: provide photos/renders, assembly details, engineering drawings,
control overview and integration details.
- System Visualisation: explain how your system is visualised (e.g. RViz) and what it
demonstrates.
- Closed-Loop Operation: describe the feedback method and how it adapts system behaviour in real time.

## Installation and Setup
- Step-by-step installation instructions for dependencies and workspace setup.
- Hardware setup information (UR5e connection, camera, Teensy, etc.).
- Any environment variables, configuration files, or calibration procedures required to run
the system. (You can take as assumed that there is some sort of hand-eye calibration
already present in the system.)

## Running the System
- Clear instructions for launching and running the complete system.
- Example commands (e.g. ros2 launch project_name bringup.launch.py).
- Expected behaviour and example outputs.
- Optional troubleshooting notes.
- The system should be launched by a single command (e.g. via a launch file, shell script
or Docker image), without manual sequencing.

## Results and Demonstration
- Describe how your system performs against its design goals.
- Include quantitative results where possible (e.g. accuracy, repeatability).
- Provide photos, figures, or videos showing the system in operation. (See Project
Overview, above.)
- Highlight robustness, adaptability, and innovation.

## Discussion and Future Work
- Briefly discuss major engineering challenges faced and how they were addressed.
- Outline opportunities for improvement or extensions – what would you do better for
“Version 2.0”.
- Summarise what makes your approach novel, creative, or particularly effective

## Contributors and Roles
- Briefly list team members and describe their primary areas of responsibility (e.g. vision,
planning, hardware).

## Repository Structure
- A short section outlining the folder structure of your repository.
- Explain briefly what each main directory contains.

## References and Acknowledgements
- Credit any external libraries, tutorials, or prior codebases.
- Acknowledge external assistance (e.g. demonstrators, other groups).
