# MTRN4231 Group Project - Burger Bot

## Purpose
This design report addresses the problem of burger assembly in the fast food industry. Due to the high paced nature of the task, mistakes are made by employees. There are also various factors that make employees unreliable, slow, expensive and produce low quality burgers. Our solution aims to solve all of these issues by utilising a UR5e robot equipped with computer vision and a custom made end effector. The design report explores our approach, iterations of end effector designs, architecture design, perception design and arm mobility.
